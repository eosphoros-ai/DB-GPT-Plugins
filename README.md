## Plugins
> For interactionless use, set ALLOWLISTED_PLUGINS=example-plugin1,example-plugin2,example-plugin3 in your .env

There are two categories of plugins: built-in party and third party. built-in party plugins are included in this repo and are installed by default when the plugin platform is installed. Third-party plugins need to be added individually. Use built-in party plugins for widely-used plugins, and third-party for your specific needs. You can view all the plugins and their contributors on this directory.

You can also see the plugins here:
